		<h4>My entire life I have been surrounded by many types of technology whether it be a computer carrying Windows 95, PSP or even the first Wii. Being raised in this type of environment allowed me to study these devices and how they function. My brother is in UTM studying Computer Science so he is a big influence on what I want to become in the future. He taught me a lot about technology and software.</h4>
